## This Repository

This repository contains a selection of files relevant to the current 
TechOlympics website, which I created in 2017-18. Of course, sensitive 
information has been redacted/removed.

Some interesting files of note are in the root directory:

-   `report.sql`: This is a monster-length SQL query for generating a full 
    report of all users and their current registration status.

-   `custom-php.php`: Custom PHP code written by me that is injected into the 
    WordPress site.

-   `gravityforms-schema.json`: Exported file from GravityForms representing the
    structure of forms that make up the registration workflow.

-   `export-pages.xml`: WordPress export of all page content.
